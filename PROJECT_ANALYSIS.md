# Tirta-SaaS Project Analysis & Development Status Update

## 📋 Project Overview

**Tirta-SaaS** is a multi-tenant water utility billing system built with Go and the Gin framework. It's designed to serve water utility companies by providing a complete SaaS solution for managing customers, tracking water usage, generating bills, and processing payments.

The system follows a B2B2C model where each water utility company (tenant) can manage their own customers and billing operations independently.

### 🏗️ Core Business Model

- **Multi-tenant Architecture**: Each water utility company operates as a separate tenant
- **Complete Billing Lifecycle**: From customer registration → usage tracking → invoice generation → payment processing
- **Flexible Pricing**: Supports multiple subscription types with complex fee structures
- **Automatic Calculations**: Water usage calculation, rate application, and invoice generation

### 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Go 1.24.2 + Gin Web Framework
- **Database**: MySQL with GORM ORM + Connection Pooling + 35+ Performance Indexes
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with bcrypt password hashing + Customer Authentication
- **Security**: Rate limiting, CORS, Security headers, Input sanitization, SQL injection protection
- **Monitoring**: Structured logging, Health checks, Metrics collection, Audit trails
- **Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI integration
- **Architecture**: Clean Architecture with separated concerns + Production middleware stack
