# Tirta-SaaS Project Analysis & Development Roadmap

## 📋 Project Overview

**Tirta-SaaS** is a multi-tenant water utility billing system built with Go and the Gin framework. It's designed to serve water utility companies by providing a complete SaaS solution for managing customers, tracking water usage, generating bills, and processing payments.

The system follows a B2B2C model where each water utility company (tenant) can manage their own customers and billing operations independently.

### 🏗️ Core Business Model

- **Multi-tenant Architecture**: Each water utility company operates as a separate tenant
- **Complete Billing Lifecycle**: From customer registration → usage tracking → invoice generation → payment processing
- **Flexible Pricing**: Supports multiple subscription types with complex fee structures
- **Automatic Calculations**: Water usage calculation, rate application, and invoice generation

### 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Go 1.24.2 + Gin Web Framework
- **Database**: MySQL with GORM ORM
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with bcrypt password hashing
- **Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI integration
- **Architecture**: Clean Architecture with separated concerns

## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### ⚠️ **Routing & API Issues**
- **Invoice Route Inconsistency**: Group path is `/api/customers` but endpoint is `/invoices/generate-monthly`
- **Missing CRUD Operations**: Many entities lack complete CRUD endpoints
- **Over-restrictive Access**: All API endpoints require admin role, no customer self-service
- **Inconsistent Path Structure**: Mixed API path conventions

### 🔐 **Security Gaps**
- **No Customer Authentication**: Customers cannot access their own data
- **Missing Rate Limiting**: No protection against API abuse
- **No Request Validation**: Limited input sanitization and validation
- **No Audit Logging**: No tracking of sensitive operations

### 📊 **Data & Performance Issues**
- **No Pagination**: List endpoints will fail with large datasets
- **Missing Indexes**: Potential performance issues with multi-tenant queries
- **No Connection Pooling**: Database connection management not optimized
- **No Caching**: No caching strategy for frequently accessed data
